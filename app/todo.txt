~ Change SnippetExtensions 'likes' attribute to a through model.
  The new model will have two foreign keys and a datetime field (the date of liking the snippet).
~ If the user has already liked the snippet, then change the 'Like' link to 'You Liked this'
~ If a logged-in User goes to their public profile link, then redirect to their dashboard.
